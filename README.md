# Getting started with Mindi® simulation and AVR®DB microcontrollers
This guide will get you up and running with simulating the analog OPAMP module in AVR DB family devices using the Mindi simulation tool.
## Configuration: Integrator
The op amp can be configured to act as an integrator, using an external capacitor and resistor.
The integrator can be reset by the event system.

Download and open the **Mindi schematic [here](schematics/)**

Press the _play_ button to simulate with an example stimulus source.

### Tweaking
The rate of integration can be adjusted by changing the external component values. The internal configuration has no adjustable parameters.

### Don't have Mindi?
Download and install [Mindi simulation tool](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-mindi)
